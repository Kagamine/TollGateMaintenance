# TollGateMaintenance

There were over than 200 toll gates in Heilongjiang, China. The bussiness in every toll gates will submit the word document which contains solved and unsolved issues about devices each season. Due to the documents were written in natrue language with random grammar and word ordering. So we have built this project on NLP technology.

We referenced to Harbin Institute of Technology LTP Model. At begining, we spilited the whole document into many issues, then analyze the characteristic or property of a certain word, by which one can determine what part of speech the word belongs to, sentence structures and semanteme. Next, analyze the result to conjecture the device, lane, phenomenon and solution. We cannot ensure the result is 100% correct, so the users could make a small modification to the analyze result.
